This project is a Java-based game created in Eclipse. The game is inspired by the classic Tower Defense genre, where players must defend their territories or possessions by obstructing enemy attackers or preventing them from reaching the exits.

The game features multiple levels with a variety of opponents and towers that have special effects. It also includes a map editor, allowing players to create custom maps. The enemies can find their way from the starting point S to the ending point E, and players can choose from three levels of difficulty. The game includes a tutorial that explains the basic gameplay.

The codebase has room for future development, and the project intends to add intelligent projectiles, A* pathfinding for minions, and a more complex story to explain the conflict in greater detail.

Getting Started

To run the game, download the repository and import it into your IDE of choice (Eclipse is recommended). The project can be executed from the "Launcher" class in the "src" folder.

Usage

Once the game is launched, the user can select the level of difficulty, play the tutorial, and start playing the game. In the game, the player can select and place towers on the map, upgrade them, and earn money by defeating enemies. The player can also sell towers and adjust the speed of the game.
