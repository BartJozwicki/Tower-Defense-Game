Tower Defense Game

The project was created in eclipse using core Java. The concept of the game is derived from the well-known 'Tower Defense game' which is to defend a player's territories 
or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exits.

The project is a multi-level game with a variety of opponents and towers with special effects.
It is also possible to create custom maps in the map editor. 
Enemies can find the path from the starting point S to the ending point E.
A player can select one of the 3 levels of difficulty.
A tutorial explaining basic gameplay is also included in the section 'Tutorial'.

Some parts of the code are left for future development.
It is intended to add 'intelligent projectiles', A* pathfinding for the minions, and a more complex story to describe the conflict in more detail.

In order to run the project, download the repository and import it into the IDE of your choice (Eclipse recommended).
